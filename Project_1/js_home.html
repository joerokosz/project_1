        <h2>What's Offered</h2>
        <p>Here at Joe Schmo personal training I look to do what's best for overall wellness. Most gyms and trainers will only provide weight training as their focus. My main goal is to expand that variety and get you to try different classes such as kickboxing, high intensity interval training, swimming, yoga and also weight training. Complimentery to all memberships is a free nutrition assessment. With these guided tools, there's no reason you shouldn't hit your goals!</p>
